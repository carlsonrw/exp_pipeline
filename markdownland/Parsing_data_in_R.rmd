# Parsing the data

Once you downloaded json data files, you can now parse them into more legible formats like csv files. Here, we will walk through steps for parsing json files in R.

You'll need `rjson` library for this, so go ahead and install the package if you don't have it installed yet.

```r
install.packages('rjson')
```

Edit the paths (i.e., `output_path` and `json_path`) to and run the following code, and you will get a single `parsed_data.csv` file with all data!

```r
library(rjson)

# set output path and file name
output_path = "out" # your output directory where csv file will be stored
output_fname = "parsed_data.csv"

# list of json files to be parsed
json_path = "aws_sync/data" # your data directory where json files lives
json_fnames = dir(path=json_path,pattern = "*.json")

# initialize dataframe
df = data.frame()

# go through each json file
for (f in json_fnames) {
	 # load file
	 tmp = jsonlite::fromJSON(sprintf("%s/%s", json_path, f), simplifyDataFrame = TRUE)
	 
	 # merge into the data frame
	 df = rbind(df, tmp)
}

# save data to a csv file
write.csv(apply(df,2,as.character), 
file = sprintf("%s/%s", output_path, output_fname),
row.names = FAE
```
